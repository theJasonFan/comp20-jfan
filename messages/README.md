###Acknowledgements:
Thanks to Prof. Ming Chow for making his examples for DOM lecture available, I used the stylesheet from his #FML example to format the messages

###Questions regarding Same Origin Policy:
######Is it possible to request the data from a different origin (e.g., http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/) or from your local machine (from file:///) from using XMLHttpRequest?

No.

######Why not?

This is because of a policy called the Same Origin Policy that prevents the exchange of information from one website to another enforced by modern Browsers.
