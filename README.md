#Jason Fan's Comp20 Private Repo

### What is the purpose of this Git Repo

This repo serves as a display of the learning done throughout the semester and as a portfolio for anyone who would like to inspect the work I have done. It serves as an example of the work I am capable of.

### What was you favourite lab or assignment and why?

Assigment 3 was by far my favorite assignment, I developed a deeper understanding of how the client-server communication works, the intricacies of HTTP, and the importance of selecting the right technologies. Node.js is fast, and easy to understand if one is familiar with JavaScipt, but the Asynchronous nature of the technology has drawbacks. A similar statement can be said of MongoDB. However, an entire development stack built with Javascript means that it is easy for a small team or even one person to build all parts of a small app.

If we coun the semester group project as an assignment, then this would by far be my favorite assignment, I have simply learnt so much from building our app, and having to both select and use many different modules/technologies.

### How much do you think you have grown from day 1 till now and what was the most important thing that you learned in this course?

So much. I can truly say that everytime I work on our group project I learnt something new. This course allowed me to develop an understanding of the technologies we interact with every day. As good as other courses in the department are, this is the only course that has allowed me to develop in this way.

The most learning was done when I learnt how to build authentication using the Google+ API and when I used Mongoose as a monogDB driver. New technologies can be intimidating and the thought of having to combine and use different technologies is even more so. But the most important thing Comp 20 has showed me that I am able to tackle and solve problems using many different tools and have formed a foundation that allows me to truly understand these tools.

### What topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I would love to learn D3 and build interesting vizualisations that allow users to digest grand amounts of information! Comp 20 has helped me in a class that required us to produce time-series analyses of large bodies of data.
