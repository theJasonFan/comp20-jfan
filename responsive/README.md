##What has been implemented correctly/incorrectly

The correct image is shown on browser for all 10 images, using image sprites and setting background image.
The image displayed varies according to the following: 

*```1200 < width        ``` - "How the customer explained it"
*```1100 < width <= 1200``` - "How the Project Leader understood it"
*```1000 < width <= 1100``` - "How the Analyst designed it"
*``` 900 < width <= 1000``` - "How the Programmer wrote it"
*``` 800 < width <=  900``` - "How the Business Consultant described it"
*``` 700 < width <=  800``` - "How the project was documented"
*``` 600 < width <=  700``` - "What operations installed"
*``` 500 < width <=  600``` - "How the customer was billed"
*``` 400 < width <=  500``` - "How it was supported"
*```       width <=  400``` - "What the customer really needed"
